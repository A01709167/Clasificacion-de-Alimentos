//The goal of this program is to create a MEAL PLAN. A meal plan has MEALS (like breakfast), a MEAL has PORTIONS (carbs, proteins and fats). Each portion has a defined ammount of calories. According to the user weight and goal, the program defines the calories, then according to the users desired SPLIT (percentage of each macronutrient) the program defines the PORTIONS and it devides it into MEALS which then the user can EDIT adding or removing "portions of carbs proteins and fats". It finally displays the plan with meals and portions per meal

//a PORTION of carbs has 77 calories
// a portion of Protein has 70 calories
// a portion of Fats has 45 calories

class user(name, weight, height, calories, state, split)
//Split is an array with the percentage of carbs (45-50%), proteins and fats. 
//Calories is the recommended maintenance calories
//state is the current state to maintain weight, maintenance, gain: bulk, loose: deficit.

user.findmaintenance() //Finds the appropriate calories to remain healthy according to weight and height
user.findDeficit() //Finds the appropriate calories to loose weight
user.findBulk() //Finds the calories to gain weight

class maintenance: user(calories)
class deficit: user(caloriesUnder)
class bulk: user(caloriesOver)

class Plan:user (numberOfMeals,   , protein, fats, meals) //Is the number of portions of each macronutrient for a maintenance Plan

plan.setMeals() //Sets how many meals to eat, regularly 5

//Sets the calories for each group according to the number of calories and split set
plan.carbs() //If calories =2000 and carb split is 50% this returns 1000/70 which is 12
	return carbCals
plan.proteins()
	return proteinCals
plan.fats()
	return fatCals

plan.seePortions() //Shows the number of portions of each group the plan has
plan.equalSplit() // Equally devides the portions of each group between the number of meals
	return equalMeal //Returns a meal with the portions
plan.showPlan() //Shows the meals and the portions of each meal

//To create a meal like BREAKFAST
class meal:plan(name, time, carbs, proteins, fats) //According to the STATE the user is in, the plan is chosen (BULK) and the meal is created according to this values
//First define the meal as equal to have an idea, but not every meal is equal as some eat less in breakfast or for snacks. Create meals according to your needs starting off EQUALMEAL
meal.equalMeal() //Sets the meal with the equal values
meal.editCarbs() //Takes or removes a portion of the meal
meal.editProteins() //Takes or removes a portion of protein
meal.editFats() //Takes or removes a portion from the equal meal
meal.seeMeal() //Displays the time to eat, the name of the meal, the calories it has and the portions
